# hello-World
this is my first repository

hello everyone

my name is Brandon and im somewhat new to co coding, still learning, mainly on codecademy so far.
I have learned html and css, though not an expert or anything, my main focus as of now is javaScript.
i will probably start back up learning python as well after I learn more javaScript.
